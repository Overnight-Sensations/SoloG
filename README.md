# About the game FILMANZA

If the player guess a letter which is a movie name, either bollywood or hollywood, the script writes it in all its correct positions. The player tries to guess the movie name by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. The player has some given turns to guess the movie name.
